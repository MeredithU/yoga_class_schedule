3) Created a Node API using Express for class data

4) Used Angular Bootstrap's accordion directive to display rates information on passes page

5) Used Twitter Bootstrap for SASS

## Set Up

1) Clone the repository

2) Install the application with: npm install

## Known Issues - Working on Fixes

1) If you click on Passes & Rates or Training in the nav bar and then click on Schedule or Studios & Contact, the $anchorScroll does not work. It only works if you are currently on the home page.

2) Selecting more than one filter within the same category does not display all of those options.
